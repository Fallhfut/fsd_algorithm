# Key parameters

All parameters are set in the `./config/skidpad_detector.yaml`  

`length/start` : Distance between track center and starting line
`length/lidar2imu` : Distance between LiDAR and imu
`length/threshold` : max threshold distance for points matching

## Step

* 1. Move package to your workspace, Copy ` ./config/path_x.txt ` , ` ./config/path_y.txt` ` ./config/skidpad.pcd` to `/home/.ros/skidpad_detector` (if not exist, create it)
* 2. Go to your workspace,  `catkin build`
* 3. `source devel/setup.bash`
* 4. `roslaunch skidpad_detector skidpad_detector.launch`
