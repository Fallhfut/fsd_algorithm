# fsd_algorithm

This repository is devoted to share the autonomous code of Beijing Institute of Technology Driverless Racing Team. Some simple version code of an autonomous FS race car and some helpful tools are included.

The use of **Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic** is assumed everywhere on this repository.

# Repository organisation

The repository consists of `ros` and `tools`,` ros` is organised in several top level packages/directories. The top level should adhere to the following subdivision of functionality(a more detailed description can be found in the folders themselves):

**perception/** - folder for perception packages

**estimation/** - folder for estimation packages

**planning/** - folder for planning packages

# Open source roadmap

Our goal is to provide a simple implementation of the competition. For ease of use, most ros node use the ros standard message type to send/recieve.  

We will continue to open source our autonomous code, when this part is stable and simple enough.
