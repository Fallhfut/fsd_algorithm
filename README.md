# fsd_algorithm

This repository is devoted to share the autonomous code of Beijing Institute of Technology Formula Student Driverless Team. Some simple version code of an autonomous FS race car and some helpful tools are also included.

The use of **Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic** is assumed everywhere on this repository.

# Repository organisation

The code is organised in several top level packages/directories. The top level should adhere to the following subdivision of functionality. A more detailed description can be found in the folders themselves.

# Open source roadmap

We will continue to open source our autonomous code, when this part is stable and simple.
